The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.special p {
  font-size: 14px !important;
}

.special p.important {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

The unexpected behavior lies in the interaction between the `!important` declaration and the specificity of selectors.  The `.special p` selector has higher specificity than the `p` selector, but the `!important` declaration in `.special p` is overridden by the even more specific `.special p.important` selector which lacks the `!important` flag.
